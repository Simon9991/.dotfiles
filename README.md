# dotfiles
My current `dotfiles`, based on [craftzdogs](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/tree/master) `dotfiles` as I am a fan of his work.
Some changes based on personal preferences, I will try to update this repository as much as needed.

This setup is optimized for web development, but also works very well with `c`, `c++`, `rust`...

## Terminal
- For MacOS, I recommend [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- For GNOME, I am using [BlackBox](https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox) with `japanesque` theme.
